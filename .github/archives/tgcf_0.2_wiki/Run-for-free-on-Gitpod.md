Gitpod is a cloud IDE used for rapid development.

If you are planning to use `tgcf`, then one way is to install it on your computer. The other way is to run it in a cloud environment. Gitpod is the easiest way to go.

1. Click this button, to open a fresh workspace in Gitpod

2. Don't worry about the huge no. of source code files in the IDE. If you are not a developer, then leave them alone.


3. `tgcf` is ready to use.
   ```shell
      tgcf --help
      # prints the CLI usage
     ```

4. Create two new files [`.env`](https://github.com/aahnik/tgcf/wiki/Environment-Variables) and [`tgcf.config.yml`](https://github.com/aahnik/tgcf/wiki/How-to-configure-tgcf-%3F) and fill them up.
