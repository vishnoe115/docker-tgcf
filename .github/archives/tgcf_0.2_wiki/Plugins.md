## Official Plugins

The official plugins are installed by default when you install `tgcf`. The source code of these plugins lies under the [`plugins` ](https://github.com/aahnik/tgcf/tree/main/tgcf/plugins) subpackage of `tgcf`.

Some of the plugins may have additional non-python dependencies, which you need to manually install. Click on the link to the plugin to learn how to use it.

## Third-Party Plugins

Third-party plugins are those which are developed by other developers. They live in their own repositories. If you have built a `tgcf` plugin, then you can list them here. Just send me a message on [Telegram](https://telegram.me/aahnikdaw).
